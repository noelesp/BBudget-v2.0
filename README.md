Church Management System


BBudget is a simple church management system for small organizations to manage church members, offerings and sunday 
school attendance. It also has limited reporting capabilities. This started as a hobby to replace the paper forms used 
to record offerings at my church. It slowly evolved and features were added such as an address book, simple reporting 
and sunday school attendance tracking.

The code is quick'n'dirty and crude. It's definitely not up to best practices and could use some clean up!
